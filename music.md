Luke Dahl produces and performs electronic dance music. Recent productions explore techno and house, but he has also made EDM, electronic pop, and experimental music.

Luke's live performances are truly live and flexible, using hardware synths and controllers to spontaneously reinterpret and rearrange his original tracks.

Recent tracks are available on [soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/lukedahl), and some older music can be heard on [myspace](http://myspace.com/lukedahl).
